                Being a developing country, power consumption has been increasing at greater pace in India. India’s
                energy sector is diversified compared to the rest of the World. Energy consumption growth rate in
                commercial buildings (8%) is more than that of Residential sector (5%) and floor area increase itself is
                expected to grow from 659 million m2 in 2010 to 1900 million m2 in 2030. But India is still in the
                nascent stage in energy conservation point of view in any of the sectors. As per the Prime Minister’s
                vision statement, Energy saving potential in Building sectors both commercial and Residential is 20%
                (NMEEE, Bureau of Energy) and shall achieve 10% of energy saving by 2022. Hence it is essential and
                crucial to focus the research on energy performance of the buildings.

            <h4 class="display-6">What is an energy audit?</h4>
            <p class="lead">Energy costs are soaring and your business can be at considerable risk if you do not take
                the guesswork out of your energy usage and the budget you need to cover it. Energy audits identify where
                your business is wasting energy.
                Energy Audit is the verification, monitoring, and analysis of the use of energy including submission of
                technical report containing recommendations for improving energy efficiency with cost-benefit analysis
                and an action plan to reduce energy consumption

        <div class="row">
            <h4 class="display-6">Why is an energy audit is required?</h4>
            <p class="lead">Energy Audit needs to be done to identify Energy saving Opportunities in a facility or areas
                with excess use of Energy compared with set up standards. An energy audit is an effective tool for
                energy management to use Energy Effectively and Efficiently.
                The energy conservation measures help in saving energy and cutting cost in electricity cost of any
                building. For every unit of energy consumption, our environment suffers a loss in the form of pollution
                and reducing conventional energy resources, more generating capacity demand.
                Saving a unit of energy not only saves money but also saves the environment and energy sources.

            <h4>1. Thermocol</h4>
            <img src="img/thermocol.png" class="col-6" style="margin: auto;" alt="">
            <p class="lead">Heat can be avoided by using a thermal insulating material on the inside or the outside of
                the walls/ceiling. XPS boards are good thermal insulators that can stop the heat flow from outside into
                a room if put on the walls or ceiling. It can provide temperature reduction of about 5 oC if applied on
                walls/ceilings that face the sun directly.
                <br><br>
                For Ceilings: These boards can be installed either as a terrace floor (over the deck installation) or as
                a false ceiling (under the deck installation). Using these boards instead of POP false ceilings can help
                save electricity as well as help in giving the right looks to a room. It is also quite easy to fabricate
                and install. To make it look as per the room décor, wall putty and paint can be applied on it.
                <br><br>
                For Walls: The board can be installed either on interior or exterior of the walls without any problems.
                Wall putty and paint can be applied on it to make it look as per the required décor.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Wall Paint (White) </h4>
            <img src="img/paint.jpg" class="col-6" style="margin: auto;" alt="">
            <p class="lead"> White cooling paints are an established cooling technology that help bring down indoor
                temperatures and thus save the electricity used for air-conditioning in hot climates.
                white paint that can keep surfaces up to 18 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than their ambient surroundings –
                almost like a refrigerator does, but without consuming energy.
                The paint would not only send heat away from a surface, but also away from Earth into deep space where
                heat travels indefinitely at the speed of light. This way, heat doesn’t get trapped within the
                atmosphere and contribute to global warming
            </p>

            <h4>3. Window Glass Pane</h4>
            <img src="img/window.png" class="col-6" style="margin: auto;" alt="">
            <p class="lead"> Window glazing is nothing but the window glass that is fitted in
                the window frames. In other words, it’s the glass pane part of your window. Most often, a single window
                glass is placed within the frame. This is done by a specialist called a glazier
                Double-glazed windows have two panes of glass fitted into a window frame. An inert gas like argon is
                filled between the two panes to increase insulation. Double glazed glass is perfect for Indian weather
                conditions, especially in North India where there are scorching summers and moderate winters. The double
                window panes not only provide relief from extreme temperatures outside, but also insulate your space
                from the noise outside. They are also very hard to break through and therefore provide you with ample
                security against intruders.
            </p>

            <h4>4. Insulation</h4>
            <p class="lead"> Wall, roof and floor insulation may be done by fixing insulation material to the wall, roof
                or floor, either on the inside of outside, e.g., by using insulation plates. Different materials for
                walls, roofs and floors require different types of insulation measures. Buildings may for example have
                cavity walls consisting of two 'skins' separated by a hollow space. This space already provides some
                insulation but can be filled up with additional insulation material, e.g., foam, to further improve the
                insulation effect. Roof insulation for flat roofs differs from insulation for steeper roofs.
                Floors are usually made of wood or concrete, each requiring specific insulation measures. Another option
                to reduce heat losses to the ground is soil insulation, for example by placing insulation material on
                the soil in a so-called “crawl space” (a very low basement).
                The age of a building is an important factor determining the type of insulation and the way in which it
                is installed, e.g., if insulation is put on the outside or inside of the construction
                Another insulation measure that reduces the amount of heat loss is sealing cracks in the ‘shell’ of the
                building. Cracks cause infiltration of cold air from outside or leakage of warm air to the outside.
                Strips or other material can be used to seal cracks in moving parts, such as windows and doors, and in
                places where different construction parts are attached to each other.
            </p>

            <h4>5. Voice Automated System</h4>
            <img src="img/voice.png" class="col-6" style="margin: auto;" alt="">
            <p class="lead"> The idea is to connect devices, which in turn connect and talk through a centralized
                control unit, accessible by computers, tablets, and mobile phones. These include lights, appliances,
                electrical outlets, and heating and cooling systems, but also alarms, doors, windows, smoke detectors,
                surveillance cameras, and many other sensors and devices.
                For example, home automation users can turn the lights on or off at specific times each day, adjust the
                heater or air conditioner to turn on a few minutes before they arrive home, or turn on all the lights in
                their home when the security system alarm is triggered. In addition to these immediate effects,
                monitoring applications can also provide accurate home information by generating detailed reports on
                equipment that could be working better or spending less. As systems such as Google Home, Alexa, and
                Amazon Echo become more and more common and artificial intelligence becomes more and more sophisticated,
                the integration of diverse applications in residential spaces should increasingly enter our daily lives
                through the Internet of Things (commonly referred to as IoT). That is, in addition to smartphones and
                personal computers, appliances and sensors are able to identify patterns, process information, and
                perform tasks both through commands and automatically

            </p>

            <h4>6. BMS(IOT)</h4>
            <img src="img/iot.jpg" class="col-6" style="margin: auto;" alt="">
            <p class="lead"> A Building Management System (BMS), sometimes called a Building Automation System (BAS), is
                a computer-based system installed to control and monitor a building's electrical equipment such as
                ventilation, lighting, energy, fire systems, and security systems. It consists of software and hardware.
                <br><br>
                A BMS is crucial to managing demand for energy in a cost-effective way and essential to all new builds.
                It allows owners and landlords of buildings to reduce energy costs and provide optimum comfort for
                users, tenants and residents of the buildings. It allows remote management of heating, ventilation and
                air conditioning (HVAC) so that maintenance staff do not have to spend time visiting each building or
                room to shut down, switch on or adjust temperature levels or air conditioning.
