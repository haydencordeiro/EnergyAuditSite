                Being a developing country, power consumption has been increasing at greater pace in India. India’s
                energy sector is diversified compared to the rest of the World. Energy consumption growth rate in
                commercial buildings (8%) is more than that of Residential sector (5%) and floor area increase itself is
                expected to grow from 659 million m2 in 2010 to 1900 million m2 in 2030. But India is still in the
                nascent stage in energy conservation point of view in any of the sectors. As per the Prime Minister’s
                vision statement, Energy saving potential in Building sectors both commercial and Residential is 20%
                (NMEEE, Bureau of Energy) and shall achieve 10% of energy saving by 2022. Hence it is essential and
                crucial to focus the research on energy performance of the buildings.

            <h4 class="display-6">What is an energy audit?</h4>
            <p class="lead">Energy costs are soaring and your business can be at considerable risk if you do not take
                the guesswork out of your energy usage and the budget you need to cover it. Energy audits identify where
                your business is wasting energy.
                Energy Audit is the verification, monitoring, and analysis of the use of energy including submission of
                technical report containing recommendations for improving energy efficiency with cost-benefit analysis
                and an action plan to reduce energy consumption

            <h4 class="display-6">Why is an energy audit is required?</h4>
            <p class="lead">Energy Audit needs to be done to identify Energy saving Opportunities in a facility or areas
                with excess use of Energy compared with set up standards. An energy audit is an effective tool for
                energy management to use Energy Effectively and Efficiently.
                The energy conservation measures help in saving energy and cutting cost in electricity cost of any
                building. For every unit of energy consumption, our environment suffers a loss in the form of pollution
                and reducing conventional energy resources, more generating capacity demand.
                Saving a unit of energy not only saves money but also saves the environment and energy sources.
